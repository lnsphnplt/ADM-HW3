Meadow Hot Springs	['hot-springs', 'water']	492	133	In the deserts of central Utah lies a trio of hot springs, an oasis of sorts for weary travelers.Formed by volcanic activity thousands of years ago, the springs are encircled in white rock, sculpted to form a set of twisted pools. The water is vibrant blue, unpolluted, and pure. They can reach a depth of up to 25-feet, making them a fun stop for amateur scuba divers. Some even claim that there are underwater tunnels between two of the pools.	This set of three large, volcanic hot springs is a favorite haunt for intrepid divers.  	['Territorial Statehouse State Park Museum', 'Mystic Hot Springs', 'Trilobite Quarry']	Meadow, Utah, 84644 United States	38.8634	-112.5063	['ppmer011', 'redhotrutabaga']	2020-03-16 00:00:00		['Lightning Ridge Artesian Bore Baths', 'Bubble Beach Spa', 'Conundrum Hot Springs', 'Lares Hot Springs']	https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/meadow-hot-springs-2
