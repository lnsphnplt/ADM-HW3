Playa de las Catedrales	['rock-formations', 'beaches', 'rocks', 'geological-oddities', 'caves', 'ecosystems', 'geology']	689	126	Located along the western boundary of the “Cantabrian rasa” along Spain’s Galician coast is a stretch of sandjust under a mile long, yet packed with a most unusual series of geologicalformations. This beach alone proves that Mother Nature had a fondness for flying buttresses eons before any human engineer patted himselfon the back for coming up with the now-iconic architectural feature.Officially calledthe Praia de Augas Santas or “Beach of the Holy Waters,” the beach is more often referred to by the name locals use for its halls of natural wonder: LaPlaya de las Catedrales, or “Beach of the Cathedrals.” So named in honor of the extraordinary natural rock formations resembling the soaring arches found in Gothic cathedrals, the unusual geology along this particular stretch of coastline gains all the moremagic forthe fact that its glory is only revealed at low tide.As the waters recede, a vista ofnatural arches, cliffs, and sea caves are revealed. The arches themselves reach 90 feet in height, while deep, eroded caves stretch backinto the cliffside.Connecting all these features are sandy patches formed by the schist and slate of the rocks themselves.Playa de Catedraleshas become a popular destination for those who feel a more holy kinship with nature, or seek to experience a touch of the divine in a new, unexpected setting.Strolling among these rocky outcroppings and exploring all these nooks and cranniesat low tide is encouraged, though keeping a vigilant eye turned toward the returning sea is a must. Thanks to the region’s extremely planar coastline, the ocean can, at times, return alarmingly quickly, for once high tide has come, all traces of the cathedrals and those basking in their glory will be inundateduntil the cycle starts anew, revealing the secrets lyingbeneath their waves.	"Natural stone arches form a walkable ""cathedral"" at low tide, then disappear entirely when the water returns. "	['Villa Excelsior', 'Roman Walls of Lugo', 'Fragas do Eume']	Ribadeo, 27795 Spain	43.5539	-7.1568	['serflac', 'aworldtotravel']	2016-02-25 00:00:00		['Enchanted City of Tamajón', 'Looking Glass Rock', 'Akiyoshido Cave', 'Bonhomme de Bourail ']	https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/playa-de-las-catedrales
