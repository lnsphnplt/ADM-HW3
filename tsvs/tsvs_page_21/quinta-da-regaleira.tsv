The architecture of the palace evokes Roman, Gothic, Renaissance and Manueline architectural styles. The construction of the current estate commenced in 1904 and most of it was concluded by 1910.The gardens are incredibly ornate. Set on a hillside, a multitude of fountains, grottoes, statues, caves, and ponds are connected both above ground via lovely paths and by a series of underground tunnels lit today by strings of Christmas lights. The grounds also include a chapel and an aquarium, built to look as if it naturally existed amongst the rock.	This eccentrically decorated palace is replete with grottoes, fountains, tunnels, and caves. 	['Castelo dos Mouros (Castle of the Moors)', 'Pena National Palace', 'Convent of the Capuchos']	2710-567 Sintra Sintra, 2710-567 Portugal	38.7963	-9.396	['geokate', 'hrnick']	2012-10-02 00:00:00		['Hotel Sidi Driss', 'Forestiere Underground Gardens', 'Upton Chamber ', 'The Caves of Nottingham']	https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/quinta-da-regaleira
