The Pinnacles	['rock-formations', 'rivers', 'geological-oddities', 'parks', 'geology']	821	176	It’s common for steep cliffs to be formedby rivers eroding their rocky edge over time. But in Boone County, Missouri, something curious happened. A mass of300 million-year-old limestone wedged between two rivers was eroded over the yearson both sides, formingageological anomaly known asthe pinnacles.The pinnaclesin Missouri (not to be confused by the California national park of the same name) is ajagged, pointyrock formationstanding 75 feet high and stretching 1,000 feet long.Bordered on one side by Kelley Creek and on another by Silver Fork Creek, the two streams have been slowly pinchingthe mass of Burlington limestone separating them, a highly reactive stone that’s dissolved by moving water.Some parts of the stonewere even carved out entirely, creating little tunnel-like windows dotting the vertical rock face.The craggy peaks are now a uniqueand often overlooked landmark, part of the 77-acre Pinnacles Youth Park, about 15 miles north of Columbia. In many ways, this geological oddity has created a natural playground for we humans.The rockyarchways, limestone boulders and carved outshelves make the siteexcellent for hiking and climbing.Aone-mile trail starts at a break in the trees on East Pinnacles Road, where a sign informs visitors that they are following the “Cat Tail Trail to Heart Attack Hill” and ascends quickly to the first of several awesome views of the valley below. Indeed, massive flat limestone exposures provide the perfect spot to sit back in the shade and enjoy the breeze drifting through the trees.Continuing along the trail, it narrows along the edge of the peaks — in some places, it’s one foot in front of the other, making sure tokeep a hand on the limestone wall. Descent is gradual and leads back to Silver Fork and the “Old Dam Crossin.” Youcan follow the creek fartherto another interesting geological feature, a narrow formation known as Shelving Rock, which isthe result of the creek undercutting the limestone, and beginning a new phase for the pinnacles.	A geological oddity formed by two rivers carving out a mass of limestone on both sides. 	['Blind Boone House', 'Neff Hall Chinese Stone Lions', 'University of Missouri Columns']	850 E Pinnacles Rd Sturgeon, Missouri United States	39.1337	-92.3227	['gtoddcomer', 'lurkerlaine']	2016-06-09 00:00:00		['Rosomača Canyon', 'Sculptured Rocks', 'Medicine Rocks State Park', 'Ausable Chasm']	https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/the-pinnacles-2-sturgeon-missouri
