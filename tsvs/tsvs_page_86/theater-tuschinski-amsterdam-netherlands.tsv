Theater Tuschinski	['architectural-oddities', 'architecture']	1126	911	The strangely beautiful art deco Theater Tuschinski in central Amsterdam was built by Abraham Icek Tuschinski, originally from Poland. The theater opened in 1921 and includes not just a film screen but also a stage for live performances and a Wurlitzer organ. The building has recently been overhauled and refurbished. It is considered to be part of the Amsterdam School of Expressionist architecture, but shows strong influence from more austere sub-genres of Art Nouveau, the Craftsman style, and indeed the related and contemporary Art Deco so popular across the pond at that time.Sadly, Tuschinski and his family were taken from Amsterdam to Nazi concetration camps. None survived.	A beautifully eclectic mix of architectural styles. 	"['KattenKabinet', ""'Beetle Sphere'"", 'The Torture Museum']"	Reguliersbreestraat 26-34 Amsterdam, 1017 CN Netherlands	52.3665	4.895	['serflac', 'naturedude']	2012-02-11 00:00:00		['The Japanese-Style\xa0House of Prospect Park South', 'Herz-Jesu-Kirche', 'Castillo Pittamiglio', 'Murtoa Stick Shed']	https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/theater-tuschinski-amsterdam-netherlands
