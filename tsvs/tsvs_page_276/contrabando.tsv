There exists one building at the site that is actually historical in nature, a small adobe building called ‘La Casita’, the rest of the site was built for the movies.Among the movies filmed here are: Dead Man’s Walk, and Streets of Laredo, both made for TV movies from the ‘Lonesome Dove’ series by Larry McMurtry.In September of 2008, Ojinaga, Mexico was inundated with rain, which led to the Rio Grande flooding into the State Park and surrounding areas. Today, the site is once again open to the public.	An abandoned movie set in the desert of West Texas. 	['Lajitas Ghost Town', 'Terlingua Ghost Town', 'Mariscal Mine']	Farm to Market 170 Redford, Texas, 79846 United States	29.2796	-103.8412	['clinton', 'annetta-black']	2009-09-24 00:00:00		['Kiosk Ghost Town', 'Rocchettine', 'Film City', 'Glenrio Ghost Town']	https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/contrabando
