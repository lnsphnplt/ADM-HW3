Blankenese Shipwrecks	['ship-graveyards', 'submarines', 'shipwrecks', 'ships']	579	130	On October 20th 1926, an old Finnish four-masted schooner-cum-motor glider, the Polstjernan, was cruising along theKiel-Canal, when its engine abruptlyexploded. Fueled by a cargo bay loaded with wood, the vessel caught fire and couldn’t be quenched.A rescue boat dragged the ship to the Elbe river while still smoldering. A few days later, it was towed away and left along the beach of Blankenese, west of Hamburg’s harbor, weighted with stones, and turned into the present-day breakwater seen now. At low tide it’s possible to walk up to the wreck without getting one’s feet wet.The Polstjernan is not alone at this site: after World War II, submarine scraps were added to the Polstjernan’s seawall. Afew meters away also lies what is left of the barge Uwe, sunk there in 1975 after colliding against the coaster Wiedau. The Uwe was torn into pieces and while most of these chunks had eventually been towed into the harbor, it became apparent its stern was too heavy, and was left between the Polstjernan and the Lighthouse of Blankenese, where it remains to this day.	Remnants of an exploded schooner and wrecked submarines form a breakwater. 	['Rote Flora', 'Herbertstraße', 'St. Pauli Elbtunnel']	Hamburg, 22587 Germany	53.5589	9.7881	['nicoscagliarini', 'mike-portanova']	2015-07-22 00:00:00	['18 Shipwrecks You Can See Without Getting Your Feet Wet']	['Cemitério de Navios (The Ship Cemetery)', 'The Ghost Fleet of Mallows Bay', 'Ghost Fleet of Truk Lagoon', 'Ship Breaking Yard of Gadani']	https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/blankenese-shipwrecks
