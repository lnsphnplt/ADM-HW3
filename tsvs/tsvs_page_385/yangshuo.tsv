Yangshuo and Moon Hill	['geological-oddities', 'natural-wonders', 'geology', 'nature']	421	304	Unlike most mountains, the karst hills of Yangshuo poke up randomly as the Li River meanders around their bases. Covered in lush, green vegetation, the natural formations create a dramatic landscape best viewed from Yangshuo’s natural arch, known as Moon Hill.Having drawn visitors with its unique formation for many years, Moon Hill was first climbed by Todd Skinner in the 1990s. Skinner was famous for his free climbing ability, and helped popularize the area with backpackers and hikers visiting China. Although there are climbing routes on Moon Hill, most visitors take the easier path to the summit, or the trail that goes through the arch.Besides Moon Hill, Yangshuo is popular with visitors looking to take cave tours or bike through the magnificent landscape created almost entirely out of karst formations.	Natural arch offers panoramic views of Yangshuo's karst hills. 	"['Reed Flute Cave', 'Mount Danxia', ""Tomb of Sa'ad Ibn Abi Waqqas""]"	Guilin China	24.7784	110.4967	['serflac', 'katielou106']	2011-11-09 00:00:00	['A World Tour of Amazing Arches']	['Slumgullion Earthflow', 'Looking Glass Rock', 'Sasso Menicante (Trembling Stone)', 'Macquarie Island']	https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/yangshuo
