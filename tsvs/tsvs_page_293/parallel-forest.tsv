Parallel Forest 	['forests', 'ecosystems']	531	143	This bizarre forest was built by the government to counteract the effects of the Dust Bowl. The trees were to act as a wind block. More than 20,000 red cedars were planted in the forest approximately six feet apart in every direction. They were also planted to grow straight up and not outward, hence the forest’s name. The forest itself stretches for about 16 acres. As with any place abandoned by the government, rumors have persisted that the forest is haunted.	A peculiar forest that was handcrafted for government experiments.  	['Wichita Mountains Buffalo Herd', 'Holy City of the Wichitas', 'Fort Sill']	Meers Rd Lawton, Oklahoma, 73507 United States	34.7504	-98.5793	['jzzbtv', 'sethco14']	2019-07-29 00:00:00		['Delaware Delicacies Smokehouse', 'Manyate Coffee Village', 'Anji Bamboo Museum', 'Enchanted Forest']	https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/parallel-forest
